[I gave a talk about a library I wrote called Methodical at Clojure/north
2020.](https://clojurenorth.com/cam-saul.html) [Methodical](https://github.com/camsaul/methodical) ports the "generic
method" parts of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) to Clojure in a Clojurey way. As far as I can tell, it's the
best/most complete port of the CLOS to Clojure out there, even though it only ports a subset of CLOS.

This talk is now available to watch on YouTube:
