Not a day goes by without someone asking me the recipe for Cam's House Sauce, widely considered one of the greatest
hot sauces in the world. Surely you are familiar with its delicate and subtle blend of habanero with notes of cinnamon
and cherry.

Now in this Coronavirus pandemic you can make it yourself from the comfort of your very own armchair. For1
a limited time only, here is the recipie:

#### Ingredients

*  11 oz of habaneros

*  11 oz of serrano peppers or equivalent (remove stems, keep everything else)

*  20 cloves of garlic

*  1 red onion (remove skin)

*  2 cups of fresh-squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice. Depending on the size of the grapefruits, this is probably about
   3 grapefruits

*  4 fl oz of white wine vinegar

*  1 tablespoon of ghost pepper salt

*  1 bunch of cilantro (leaves only)


Needless to say, either grow all of these ingredients yourself or be sure to use the highest-quality organic
free-range peppers and herbs.

#### Instructions

1. Throw everything in a blender and blend until it is a nice puree

1. Take resulting pulp and run thru a juicer.

1.  Bring to a boil in a pot. Important! Make sure you use a non-reactive pot such as stainless steel. Don't use
    aluminum unless you want it to taste weird.

1. Reduce heat and simmer 20 mins.

After that you can take it off the heat and bottle it with the hot fill method. I think this makes somewhere between 5
and 10 bottles the size of the ones in the picture above.

#### Final Thoughts

The lawyers advised me against giving away trade secrets like these for nothing, but I couldn't resist the urge to
lend a helping hand in this time of need. Also I wanted to type this recipe up in case I lose the envelope I wrote it
down on that I've been using for the last 2 years:
